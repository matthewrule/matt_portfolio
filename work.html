        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This project addressed a very competitive market in the realm of
          cloud storage. With the likes of Apple, Google, and Microsoft having
          a firm grasp on user’s; CloudNebula sought to differentiate itself
          from these prime competitors through the ease of use, functionality
          across platforms, design esthetics, and ability to be more than just
          a “cloud storage” app. </p>
          <ul class="problems_list" style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <h3> Problem this Product Solves:</h3>
            <li>Ability to organize content into folders, groups, tags, categories, etc.</li>
            <li>A one stop shop for users to connect professionally and socially.</li>
            <li>Two way shareability in regards to files and folders; very collaborative.</li>
            <li>Connecting with other users for real-time collaboration in notes or documents.</li>
            <li>Cohesive organizational abilities.

      <div class="competitive_analysis">
        <h1> Competitive Analysis </h1>
        <p> From our survey the top three used cloud storage companies were
          Google Drive, Apple iCloud, and Dropbox. Since these were the most
          prominently used options for storage, CloudNebula would leverage all
          the positive options like connectivity that iCloud offers through
          multiple devices, privacy by Dropbox, and storage amount and ease of
          use Google Drive offers. It then would make a seamless experience and
          offer more features.</p>

  <p> Following our information from our user stories flows were developed for
    New and Returning users. Detailed paths were created for signing on,
    creating content, and uploading content. These flows were key and served as
    a template for the creation of CloudNebula.</p>

    <p>CloudNebula is taking a modern approach to app development and design
      through the use of a more modern color palette with purple, gold hues,
      and a red CTA button. The white text itself is modern “knockout text”
      will show up really well on app as well as in desktop form. With the
      text, color palette, and theme CloudNebula is offering an experience beyond
      the traditional white backgroud of cloud platforms. It is allowing the
      user to feel like it's more than just a place to store documents, but
      as client stated a more social media feel and approach.

  <p> Using our previous information from user stories and user flows as well
    as the research that we gathered from our competitors; we then were able to
     start to assemble some simple low fidelity wireframes for the beginning
     stages of CloudNebula. I went through and personally signed up for each of
     the cloud services in the competitive analysis and added parts that I
     thought were key, and other parts I took out that were either redundant or
      didn’t need to be there. </p>
</div>
<div class="preference_testing_CN">
  <h1> Preference Testing </h1>
  <p>For my preference testing there were a few elements that I myself was
    unsure of and was curious what the shareholders would have said. The three
    things that I found to be the hardest was the logo design, color scheme and
    palette, and layout of the homepage buttons. This was the area in which I
    set up my preference test. </p>

  <p>The logo was difficult because I did choose a very bright color scheme and felt
    that a simpler design would esthetically be better on the eye. However I didn’t
    want to lose the hierarchy nor the image of the company. The preference test
    came back as 50/50 for either logo which I think is ok and I would take this
    information to the shareholders and give them the option of which one they like
    best.</p>

  <p>The color scheme was the hardest for me to decide on. White is arguably the most
    popular in cloud storage and social media apps, followed by blue color hues.
    This would have been the easy choice to delve into a similar palette, but the
    whole goal of CloudNebula and what was proposed was to differentiate it from
    the rest and really make it stand out in a field dominated by big companies
    such as Google and Apple. Again it came back 50/50 so options for the
    shareholders to take on a bold decision or possibly play it a little safer and
    similar to other cloud storage options.</p>

  <p>Lastly, was the layout and buttons of the homepage. The issue was to make the
    buttons simple without text or kind of technical with text. 75% of users found
    that simple was better and that is what we used in the app, so I would relay
    this to the shareholders as the best viable product for this specific design
    and app.

    <p> CloudNebula was set to user as a collaboration app as well as a cloud
      storage app with the feel of a social media app. A tall order, but what we
      have been able to accomplish is a fun, but professional design that appeals
      to many users in many different fields.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="cn_conclusion">
    <h1> Conclusion </h1>
    <p> One of the biggest challenges facing me in this project was after
      submitting the user survey and realizing that 100% of users tested have
      a cloud storage option and 86% of them were indeed content with their
      cloud storage. In my mind I had to figure out what they were most happy
      with, and then what the rest of the 14% maybe didn’t like and potentially
      improve in that area. Through our user testing We were able to figure out
       where the users wanted more and we leveraged that in CloudNebula.</p>

      <p>Another personal challenge that I didn’t necessarily think about ahead
       of time was the color scheme and branding elements. In our competitive
       research I realized for the most part all the cloud storage options had
       a simple white color palette with maybe a little blue. In order for
       CloudNebula to stand out from the crowd it had to be different in the
       color field or it would be bundled together with the rest of the cloud
       storage apps, hence the decision to be a bold purple with gold and
       yellow accented app. </p>

      <p>I feel that the app turned out really really well, but I think that
        more user testing in the abilities that the app does and potentially
        refining the color palette even more would further strengthen the
        competitiveness of CloudNebula going into the full developmental stages.</p>
